**Explanation of Smart Contract**
1. In this smart contract i create my own ERC20 Token. I will take a real world situation, where the **World Health Organization** wants to generate their own **Health Fund Token**.
2. And then the organization send the tokens to Different country address.
3. Only the WHO Chief can able to mint the tokens.
4. And the Countries has the right to transfer the token to different Country. And also able to burn the token.

**How you able to interact with the contract?**
1. Go on Remix IDE, paste the code and then compile and deploy it.
2. Make sure you have multiple accounts with Ethers in it. (Try VM Remix Paris)
3. Then deploy the contract.
4. Now first we have to mint the tokens and So we need the country address where we want to mint the tokens.
5. After minting, choose different account and try other functionalities like Burning and the transfer of tokens.

**How this can be a revolution?**
1. In the era of Web3 when everything is going to be decentralized, this method to give the aid to a particular country through ERC20 Token should be a revolutionery idea, not just the WHO, we can implement this in many domains.
